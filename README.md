## Introduction

In this README, I share the initial journey of developing the AI Crisis Management System. As a single developer at the helm, I'll outline the groundwork done so far and the ambitious future plans that aim to reshape how we respond to crises using AI insights.

## AI Crisis Management System

### Current Progress

At this early stage, I've made initial strides in developing a rudimentary Crisis Management System that aims to evaluate threats using real-time data analysis. The focus has been on understanding data sources and conceptualizing the decision-making process. Key aspects include:

- **Data Source Exploration:** I've been exploring sources such as live weather data, Reddit news, and Twitter updates to understand the potential data streams for threat assessment.
- **Basic Decision Logic:** The project's core is a basic AI logic that processes this preliminary data, hinting at the future decision-making capabilities.

### Next Steps

Moving forward, my primary goals are:

- **Data Integration:** I plan to integrate live weather and news data through APIs, laying the foundation for more accurate threat assessment.
- **System Refinement:** I'll be enhancing the system's logic, striving to achieve more meaningful insights even at this early stage.

## Fusion of Graph Neural Networks with Temporal Models

### Preliminary Exploration

I've begun exploring the idea of combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Temporal Models, even though it's in its nascent stages. My current focus is on:

- **Understanding GNNs:** I'm diving into GNNs to see how they could model relationships between entities during crises.
- **Temporal Components:** I'm researching Temporal Models like RNNs and Transformers to gain insights into time-series data analysis.

### Aspirations

While this fusion is still a distant aspiration, I'm excited about the potential outcomes:

- **Deeper Insights:** GNNs and Temporal Models together could offer more profound insights into complex relationships and behavior patterns.
- **Enhanced Decision Support:** This fusion could eventually contribute to better crisis evaluation, recommendation, and adaptation.

## Long-Term Vision

The long-term vision for this project centers around building autonomous learning capabilities, refining decision logic, scalability, and ultimately making a meaningful impact on crisis management. Although it's just me working on this endeavor, I believe that even a solo effort can contribute to reshaping how we tackle global challenges using AI.

Thank you for joining me on this early journey of redefining crisis management through AI.
